            <h3>Steps to create the dish:</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>In a very large stock pot, fully cover your beef soup bones (or combination of beef parts) in water and put on high heat</li>
                <li>While your beef parts come to a quick boil (about 10 minutes boiling time), take your piece of ginger and one of your onions and char them (yes, blacken and the exterior) under your broiler or in a pan on the stove-top</li>
                <li>Remove your garlic from its skin and set aside</li>
                <li>Once the beef parts have par-boiled (that about 10 minute boil!), dump everything out into a colander in the sink... Bye-bye par-boil water!</li>
                <li>Rinse your beef parts under running water and rinse your stock pot out (Careful: things might be hot!)</li>
                <li>Add the cleaned beef parts back into the stock pot and again cover with water, bring it all back up to a bare simmer on the stove</li>
                <li>Now, the waiting game starts, from this point for the next 4 hours, you'll let the pot simmer, occasionally removing the scum that rises to the top from the pot</li>
                <li>While the soup simmers, take all your whole spices and toast them in a pan on medium heat until you see them darken a bit and smell their amazing aroma</li>
                <li>Once the 4 hour mark passes (or a bit longer, up to you), take your toasted spices and put them in an easily removable cloth spice bag (sifting out loose spices is a chore) and into the pot it goes</li>
                <li>Same with your charred onion and ginger and garlic, get all that goodness into the pot</li>
                <li>By now, the burdgeoning broth should smell wonderful</li>
                <li>Again, we're going back to that riveting waiting game</li>
                <li>Periodically, you can add in things like a glug or two of fish sauce, some salt, some rock sugar, etc.</li>
                <li>We want this broth to simmer, not boil, for as long as possible</li>
                <li>After seven hours of simmering, serve over cooked rice noodles, top with your sliced raw beef (it'll cook in the hot broth), thai basil, cilantro, paper thin sliced onions, lime, sriracha if you want, anything!</li>
            </ol>
                <p>Technically speaking, it's 'ready' to serve over your cooked rice noodles after that seventh hour of simmering.</p>
                <p>But it'll only deepen in flavor the longer it goes. If you're planning a long broth (12, 24, 36 hours), go ahead and save adding the aromatics until the last planned four to six hours of simmering.</p>
