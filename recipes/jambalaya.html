            <h3>Steps to create the dish:</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Dice your onions, celery and bell peppers</li>
                <li>Cut andioulle into medallion shaped slices and chicken into cubes</li>
                <li>Remove your garlic from its skin</li>
                <li>In a heavy pot, toss in butter or oil and heat the pot</li>
                <li>Once hot, brown your sausage slices until nice and dark on both sides</li>
                <li>Brown the chicken cubes but don't over cook them!</li>
                <li>Same for the shrimps, toss them in to sizzle on both sides in the oil but don't over cook them!</li>
                <li>Once all your meats are browned, remove them from the pot and set them aside (it's best to brown the meat in batches, pulling them out of the pot and setting them aside then moving to the next protein)</li>
                <li>Next, toss your onion into the hot pot of oil (you should ensure you're keeping as much oil as you can in the pot!)</li>
                <li>Sweat your onions down. Letting them get a head start before the other veggies, giving them a little color on the edges deepens that kickin' flavor!</li>
                <li>Once your onions are looking translucent and getting a little color to the edges add in the rest of your diced veggies</li>
                <li>Cook down your veggies until they begin to soften and darken</li>
                <li>Toss in a tablespoon or two of tomato paste and mix onto the veggies, cooking the mixture to caramelize it a bit</li>
                <li>Toss in the can of crushed tomatoes, mixing and cooking to caramelize a bit as well</li>
                <li>Add your Cajun spice blend and bay leaves</li>
                <li>Add all your meats back in to finish their cooking inside the dish!</li>
                <li>Pour in chicken stock and heat til it's boiling</li>
                <li>Add in your rice and stir to combine, bring to a boil once more and turn to low</li>
                <li>Put your lid on top and cook your rice in the mixture until soft and cooked thoroughly (15 to 25 minutes, checking periodically)</li>
                <li>Once cooked thoroughly, pull off heat, mix to fluff and serve in a bowl with chopped cilantro, green onion and lime to squeeze on top! (All optional)</li>
            </ol>
