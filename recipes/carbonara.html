            <h3>Steps to create the dish:</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Bring water to a boil with a half tablespoon or so of salt added to it</li>
                <li>Once water is boiling, add your noodles and cook until preferred texture</li>
                <li>Remove your garlic from its skin and mince it finely</li>
                <li>Grate your chosen cheese as finely as your grater allows</li>
                <li>Dice your meat into small chunks, reseve some pieces to keep large to top your pasta with</li>
                <li>Heat a sautee pan on medium heat and add your preferred oil or butter</li>
                <li>Once appropriately heated, toss in your chosen meat and sautee until it starts to brown and oil is released</li>
                <li>In a bowl, separate two egg yolks from the whites</li>
                <li>Into your yolks, crack a healthy amount of fresh black pepper and add a bit of salt and your finely grated cheese, reserving some cheese for garnish</li>
                <li>Stir the yolk, pepper and cheese until combined</li>
                <li>Once your meat has browned to your preference, remove the larger chunks and set aside</li>
                <li>Add your cooked noodles into the pan and let everything warm up</li>
                <li>Once warm, kill the heat and pull the pan aside and add in your egg yolk miixture</li>
                <li>It will look thick at first but work it around, adding in a spoonful or two of your pasta water</li>
                <li>Once your carbonara sauce comes together in a silky smooth coating, transfer to a plate, top with reserved meat and garnish with reserved cheese!</li>
